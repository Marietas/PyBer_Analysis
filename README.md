# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The PyBer Analysis aims to visualize the ride-sharing data through multiple line graphs to understand the weekly performance per region. 

## Results

As shown in Figure 1, the Urban type has a higher demand for rides, followed by Suburban and Rural. Consequently, Urban rides present the highest total drivers and total fares, and Rural the lowest. 

When evaluating the Average Fare per Ride vs. Average Fare per Driver, a point to highlight is that the Urban type follows an opposite tendency. This results from a high number of drivers available vs. the Total Rides, which means that there is more offer in the Urban type than demand.

## Summary

After to peform this evaluation, the following points can be recommended:

- Inittialy, it is possible to note that the average fare per ride and driver is much higher once there are a reduced number of drivers (specially for surburban and rural cities). Based on that, and considering the period of the data collected, the company may need to apply different ride sharing rates to make the business more efficient for those kind of cities.

- Considering the urban cities, clearly the data show that there are more drives available than number of riders. The company may consider reevaluate the total amount of drivers and make a re-arrangement in order to increase the offer in other kind of cities.

- Even though with higher number of drivers available, this evaluation shows also that urban cities generate the higher revenue than the other cities.

- Finally, considering the total number of trips, drivers, and fares, the ride sharing differ significantly in urban, suburban and rural cities. Data supports the increased use of ride sharing services in urban cities.
