# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The PyBer Analysis aims to visualize the ride-sharing data through multiple line graphs to understand the weekly performance per region. 

## Results

As shown in Figure 1, the Urban type has a higher demand for rides, followed by Suburban and Rural. Consequently, Urban rides present the highest total drivers and total fares, and Rural the lowest. 

When evaluating the Average Fare per Ride vs. Average Fare per Driver, a point to highlight is that the Urban type follows an opposite tendency. This results from a high number of drivers available vs. the Total Rides, which means that there is more offer in the Urban type than demand.

The multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type is presented in the graph below. The results plotted in the graph show that except for the Urban type, the total fare for both the Rural and Suburban types follows a stable behavior from March to April. On the other hand, the Urbanâ€™s fare shows an up and downtrend during the same period. 

Overall, for the period evaluated (January to April), Urban has the highest total fares than the other types due to the demand

## Summary

After performing this evaluation, we feel confident to recommend the following to improve the performance of the company:

- Initially, it is possible to note that the average fare per ride and driver is much higher once there are fewer drivers (especially for suburban and rural cities). Based on that, and considering the period of the data collected, the company may need to apply different ride-sharing rates to make the business more efficient for those kinds of cities.

- Considering the urban cities, clearly, the data show that there are more drivers available than the number of riders. The company may consider reevaluating the total number of drivers in this type of city and make them available in the other cities to increase the offer.

- Finally, considering the total number of trips, drivers, and fares, the ride-sharing differs significantly in urban, suburban, and rural cities. Data supports the increased use of ride-sharing services in urban cities. As a result, it will be essential to launch a marketing strategy to increase the revenue in the other cities.
