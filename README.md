# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The PyBer Analysis aims to visualize the ride-sharing data through multiple line graphs to understand the weekly performance per region. 

## Results

As shown in Figure 1, the Urban type has a higher demand for rides, followed by Suburban and Rural. Consequently, Urban rides present the highest total drivers and total fares, and Rural the lowest. 

When evaluating the Average Fare per Ride vs. Average Fare per Driver, a point to highlight is that the Urban type follows an opposite tendency. This results from a high number of drivers available vs. the Total Rides, which means that there is more offer in the Urban type than demand.
